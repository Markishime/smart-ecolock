# Fix for "Redefinition of 'void nonBlockingDelay(long unsigned int)'" Error

You need to remove the duplicate function definition in your code.ino file. The error occurs because the `nonBlockingDelay` function is defined twice:
1. First at line 329
2. Again at line 1773

## Step 1: Keep only one implementation (the improved one)

The best version of the function to keep is the enhanced version which includes watchdog protection. Make sure you have only one definition of the function with this implementation:

```cpp
void nonBlockingDelay(unsigned long ms) {
  unsigned long start = millis();
  while (millis() - start < ms) {
    yield(); // This is crucial - allows other tasks to run
    // Add a small actual delay to prevent tight looping that could still trigger watchdog
    delay(1);
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Find and Remove the Second Implementation

Search for "// Enhanced nonBlockingDelay that yields to prevent watchdog timeouts" in your code. 
You'll find this comment followed by a second implementation of the nonBlockingDelay function.
Delete this entire second function implementation (you can keep the comment if you like).

## Step 3: Update your Function Declaration

Make sure the function declaration at the top of your file matches the implementation:

```cpp
void nonBlockingDelay(unsigned long ms);
```

## Once you make these changes, your code should compile without the redefinition error.
